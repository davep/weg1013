Changes since 1.0.12
====================

o WEG now accepts files dragged from explorer and dropped onto the main
  window. This is used as another method of opening a guide.
o WEG now accepts files dragged from explorer and dropped onto the guide
  manager. This is used as another method of adding guides to the guide
  manager.

Changes since 1.0.11
====================

o The preferences dialog had the wrong application name in its title. Oops!
o Removed the memory usage panel from the stats bar, WEG is now past initial
  development.
o The status bar now displays the full "menu path" of the entry you are
  viewing.
o WEG will now (as an option) display the guide title and "path" in the title
  bar of the window.
o The keyboard handler for the guide entry frame would attempt to set focus
  to the "menu" tree when escape was pressed at the "top level" no matter if
  the menu was visible or not. Fixed.

Changes since 1.0.10
====================

o There is now an option to allow single click jumping (kind of like using a
  link in a web browser). Note that this does muck up marking using the mouse
  (if using the single click option) and keyboard navigation, I'll see if there
  is a way round this at some point in the future.
o Added a "foretracking" system. This allows you to backtrack from a
  backtrack.
o The URL scanner will now detect a few extra URL types.
o When opening a guide the first menu entry is now selected by default.
o The expand/collapse status of the guide menu is now "sticky" for each
  viewing session.
  
Changes since 1.0.9
===================

o Slight change to the search code in egFinder that should give a slight
  speed increase (Thanks to Viktor Trunov for this suggestion).
o The global finder now uses AnsiUpperCase() instead of UpperCase() when doing
  a case insensitive search (Thanks to Viktor Trunov for this suggestion).
o Double clicking in the menu tree will cause WEG to re-load the guide entry
  pointed to by the currently selected menu option.
o Added scrollbars to the credits box in the about dialog as per the suggestion
  from Viktor Trunov.
o Added a backtracking system.
o Fixed a small bug that resulted in the navigation menu options and navigation
  speed buttons not getting correctly updated all the time.
o Global OEM->ANSI conversion is now an option which can be set from the
  preferences dialog.
o Another small speed increase in the global finder. I was updating the
  progress bar way too often.
o Menu titles and prompts are now trimmed of leading and trailing spaces.
o You can now copy the text to the clipboad with Ctrl-Ins.
o You can now copy the source to the clipboard with Shift-Ins.
o Added a bookmarking system.
o Extra DOS-a-like keyboard handling in the main viewer form.
o As well as remembering which guide you were reading WEG now remebers which
  entry you were looking at and which line was focused.
o As a visual aid to show which lines are "links" in the entry viewer the
  mouse cursor will turn to a hand. I'm not sure if I like this yet.

Changes since 1.0.8
===================

o You can now "browse" for the default guide directory in the prefs dialog.
o Very small speed-up of the owner draw code for the entry listbox.
o "Selected" entry lines now have a slightly different colour from the
  "focused" entry line.
o Started to take into account Oem/Ansi differences.
o Minor improvement to the URL scanning code.
o The "Re-Open" menu option now shows guide titles instead of file names.
o Some fixed pitch fonts don't print as fixed pitch fonts, added a workaround
  for this.
o Finally got round to working out what the "unknown long" was in the guide
  entries. It is two words, first is the menu the entry hangs off and second
  is the prompt of the menu it hangs off. Added these instance variables to
  TNGEntry.
o The menu tree now correctly "tracks" the entry you are viewing. This is
  of most use when jumping around using the global finder or see also
  entries.
  
Changes since 1.0.7
===================

o Experimental feature - URL Scanner.
o Added a toolbar button for the URL scanner.
o Small changes to the layout of the global finder.
o The global finder can now search all known Norton Guides.
o Added thread priority control to the global finder.
o Got round to drawing the "small" icon.
 
Changes since 1.0.6
===================

o Some cosmetic changes to the toolbar.
o The menu tree now has a "sticky" highlight.
o The guide list in the guide manager now has a "sticky" highlight.
o Search text in the guide wide finder how has a history.
o The guide wide finder now has a location and content memory.
o Incorperated fix from K.E. McFeely that stops you from adding duplicate
  entries to the guide manager.
o Improved the error reporting when adding guides to the guide manager.
o Make Expand/Collapse tree branches avaialble from the View menu.
o The credits box in the About dialog now uses the font you've selected for
  viewing the guide entries.
o The version number in the about box is now taken from the file's version
  number resource.

Changes since 1.0.5
===================

o Added the view menu and the "Show/Hide guide menu" option.
o Added the Guide Manager.
o Added a toolbar button for the guide manager.
o The contact email address in the about box is now a clickable link.
o The entry viewing list box (right hand panel) is now a multi-select
  list box, this will allow various operations to work on the selected
  lines.
o Clipboard text copy is now range aware.
o Clipboard source copy is now range aware.
o Text save is now range aware.
o Source save is now range aware.
o Print is now range aware (I think, I've run out of paper <g>).
o I wasn't un-RLEing the spaces in the menu items. Fixed.
o Using the see-also drop down list box with the keyboard now works fine.
o The progress bar in the guide wide finder window now clears when the search
  is stopped or is complete (seems to make more sense).
o Added a right click menu to the entry viewing pane.    

Changes since 1.0.4
===================

o Changed some of the toolbar button images.
o Added a toolbar button for the guide wide search.
o Changed the global search so that when you do a short-only/long-only
  search it only loads those entry types and totally skips the others. This
  can make such searches a *lot* faster.
o Fixed the "multiple entry paint on load" problem.
o Added some more Dos/Linux EG keystroke compatibility to the entry viewer.
o Re-wrote ngReadStrZ() so that it is much faster.
o Re-wrote TNGEntry.stripControls() so that it is a bit faster.
o When jumping to an entry from the global guide search, if the main window
  is viewing the entry that contains the "hit" the listbox cursor is simply
  moved, previously it re-loaded the entry first. This can make jumping to a
  hit much quicker.  

Changes since 1.0.3
===================

o Re-wrote all file I/O to use TFileStream.
o Guides are now opened in shared mode.
o Fixed a bug in the owner draw code that used Hex2Char() to get the value
  of a hex colour attribute. Hex2Char() would convert a NUL to a SPACE
  (for obvious reasons) but this obviously mucked up the colour of 0.
  Re-named Hex2Char() as Hex2Int() (without the NUL check) and wrote
  Hex2Char() as a wrapper for Hex2Int() (with the checking).
o The entry panel will now accept most of the keystrokes you'd know and love
  from Norton Guide, Expert Help and other flavours of Expert Guide.
o Added the threaded guide wide searcher.

Changes Since 1.0.2
===================

o Window size/location is no longer saved if the window is maximized.
o Correct use of the hour glass cursor.
o Bold colours were being painted for the reverse attribute, fixed.
o The DOS colour map is now user configurable.
o Added MessageBeep()s where required.
o Minor font fiddling.
